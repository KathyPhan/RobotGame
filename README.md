# RobotGame
2D slider game where you can use the arrow key or the A and D key to move left and right.
The space bar will be to jump and the left mouse key will be to normal punch. 
There will be a time limit so the goal of the game is to basically get to the top as fast as you can and jump like your reaching for the moon when you reach the last platform to win. You won't die when you fall. The only thing you'll lose when falling is time. There are also crates which can be detroyed when you click on them.
The . key will change the color of the robot.
